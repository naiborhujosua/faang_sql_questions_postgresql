-- Question 102
-- The Employee table holds the salary information in a year.

-- Write a SQL to get the cumulative sum of an employee's salary over a period of 3 months but exclude the most recent month.

-- The result should be displayed by 'Id' ascending, and then by 'Month' descending.

-- Example
-- Input

-- | Id | Month | Salary |
-- |----|-------|--------|
-- | 1  | 1     | 20     |
-- | 2  | 1     | 20     |
-- | 1  | 2     | 30     |
-- | 2  | 2     | 30     |
-- | 3  | 2     | 40     |
-- | 1  | 3     | 40     |
-- | 3  | 3     | 60     |
-- | 1  | 4     | 60     |
-- | 3  | 4     | 70     |

-- Output

-- | Id | Month | Salary |
-- |----|-------|--------|
-- | 1  | 3     | 90     |
-- | 1  | 2     | 50     |
-- | 1  | 1     | 20     |
-- | 2  | 1     | 20     |
-- | 3  | 3     | 100    |
-- | 3  | 2     | 40     |
 

-- Explanation
-- Employee '1' has 3 salary records for the following 3 months except the most recent month '4': salary 40 for month '3', 30 for month '2' and 20 for month '1'
-- So the cumulative sum of salary of this employee over 3 months is 90(40+30+20), 50(30+20) and 20 respectively.

-- | Id | Month | Salary |
-- |----|-------|--------|
-- | 1  | 3     | 90     |
-- | 1  | 2     | 50     |
-- | 1  | 1     | 20     |
-- Employee '2' only has one salary record (month '1') except its most recent month '2'.
-- | Id | Month | Salary |
-- |----|-------|--------|
-- | 2  | 1     | 20     |
 

-- Employ '3' has two salary records except its most recent pay month '4': month '3' with 60 and month '2' with 40. So the cumulative salary is as following.
-- | Id | Month | Salary |
-- |----|-------|--------|
-- | 3  | 3     | 100    |
-- | 3  | 2     | 40     |

-- Solution
with t1 as(
select *, max(month) over(partition by id) as recent_month
from employee)

select id, month, sum(salary) over(partition by id order by month rows between 2 preceding and current row) as salary
from t1
where month<recent_month
order by 1, 2 desc
