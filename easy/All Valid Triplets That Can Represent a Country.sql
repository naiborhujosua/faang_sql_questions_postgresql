-- There is a country with three schools, where each student is enrolled in exactly one school. 
-- The country is joining a competition and wants to select one student from each school to represent the country such that:

-- 1. member_A is selected from SchoolA,
-- 2. member_B is selected from SchoolB,
-- 3. member_C is selected from SchoolC, and

-- The selected studentsâ€™ names and IDs are pairwise distinct (i.e. no two students share the same name, and no two students share the same ID).
--Write an SQL query to find all the possible triplets representing the country under the given constraints.
-- Return the result table in any order.
--The query result format is in the following example.

-- SchoolA table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | Alice        |
| 2          | Bob          |
+------------+--------------+

-- SchoolB table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 3          | Tom          |
+------------+--------------+

-- SchoolC table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 3          | Tom          |
| 2          | Jerry        |
| 10         | Alice        |
+------------+--------------+

-- Result table:
+----------+----------+----------+
| member_A | member_B | member_C |
+----------+----------+----------+
| Alice    | Tom      | Jerry    |
| Bob      | Tom      | Alice    |
+----------+----------+----------+
-- Let us see all the possible triplets.
- (Alice, Tom, Tom) --> Rejected because member_B and member_C have the same name and the same ID.
- (Alice, Tom, Jerry) --> Valid triplet.
- (Alice, Tom, Alice) --> Rejected because member_A and member_C have the same name.
- (Bob, Tom, Tom) --> Rejected because member_B and member_C have the same name and the same ID.
- (Bob, Tom, Jerry) --> Rejected because member_A and member_C have the same ID.
- (Bob, Tom, Alice) --> Valid triplet.
